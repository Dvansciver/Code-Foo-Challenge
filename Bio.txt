Experience:
	I have worked on many projects for my courses, but as far as jobs go, my only experience is with IT Services at Franklin College working directly under the Web Administrator, Daniel T. Doles.I was given tasks to convert pages of the schools website from Cold Fusion to ASP code with VB code-behind.Although I have had only one real job with computing thus far, IGN would be a great environment to improve my skills and learn new ones. I am very passionate about IGN and coding, and I believe I could be a great addition to the company.
